                Rosmini College is a Catholic Boys’ School founded by the Rosminian order to provide a Catholic
                education to
                young men on Auckland’s North Shore. We aim to shape them into well-rounded young men ready to leave
                school
                who are able to make a positive contribution to society and are empowered to serve others by living out
                the
                founder’s maxims.
                Our Mission: Rosmini College supports and develops well-rounded young men while keeping true to the
                maxims
                of Antonio Rosmini. A holistic education in the Rosminian tradition that fosters a genuine encounter
                with
                Christ.
                Our Vision: Christ-centred young men who have the values, attitudes, knowledge and skills to fulfil
                their
                life and be empowered to serve others.
                Our Values: Dignity. Integrity. Fairness. Charity. Justice
                Our Motto: Charity fulfils the law.
                Treaty of Waitangi: Rosmini College is committed to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and
                actively
                supports and encourages the achievement of its Maori pupils and fosters Maori culture.
                Special Character: Rosmini College is a learning community that requires each student to pursue his
                fullest
                potential in spiritual, academic, social, cultural and co-curricular pursuits. The school will equip
                each
                student with the desire to keep the Law of Christ;
                “Love the Lord your God with your whole heart and your neighbour as yourself.”
